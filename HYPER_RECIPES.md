Hi,

Thanks for your interest in working at Hyper. We are a bunch of passionate developers that enjoy
making cool apps and having fun (not necessarily in that order). You'll love it here. :)

Even though you could try and convince us to hire you for your good humor, charm, or cool name, we
really care about majestic code. If you have any cool projects in GitHub that you can show us,
please send them to us, especially if it's one that you use on a daily basis. But if that's not the
case, don't sweat it, we have this cool assignment called Hyper Recipes that you'll probably finish
in a few hours.

In Hyper Recipes, you'll build an application that will present a collection of recipes fetched from
our [custom backend endpoint](http://hyper-recipes.herokuapp.com/recipes). Other endpoints are 
available if you are feeling adventurous. You decide the level of complexity, functionality and the
look and feel of the application. We appreciate good looking apps and thoughtful user experiences,
Google Play Store is a great source of inspiration.

If you want to have go at the recipes app (or we urge you to), we'll make you a nice and clean repo
which you will fill with marvellous code. In our daily work, we work by submitting pull requests for
all our features, updates, refactorings and bugfixes, and that's how we would like you to work,
too. So start out by cloning the repo, create a new branch and start submitting your pull requests!
Remember to keep the commits as small and specific as possible. When you have a feature done (or you
want our comment on something), push it to GitHub and create a pull request, so we can review and
comment on it. We tend to enjoy some popcorn while reviewing your app, reading the code as if it
was a fantasy book filled with dragons and unicorns. Please make it shine.

Feel free to use any external libraries you are comfortable with, or keep it vanilla, it's up to
you.

The API documentation for the backend that will store your delicious recipes can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperoslo/hyper-recipes/blob/master/README.md).

Thanks, we hope you'll enjoy making your app!
